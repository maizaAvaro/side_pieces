This project's web interface can be viewed on my (Nathan's) VM at 
172.17.152.51:8080/CoursePicker
This must be viewed on a UGA network in order for the VM to connect.
You can pick a requirement in the drop-down box and a list of the courses 
that fill this particular requirement will be displayed using a database that
has been populated with this information from the current UGA website. You can 
then add classes by clicking the add class button for a class you wish to add.
Once all classes you wish to add have been clicked, you can scroll to the bottom
of the screen and click view schedule, to view a javascript calendar of your 
currently selected schedule.
