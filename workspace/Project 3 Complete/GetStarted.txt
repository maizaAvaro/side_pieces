
Description:


Four In A Row is a two-player board game in which the 
objective is to be the first to get four of one's 
own discs in a line.


Rules:


The game is played on a board with 7 columns and 6 rows, which is placed 
in a vertical position. The players have 21 discs each, distinguished by a 
character image. The players take turns dropping discs in any of the non-full columns. 
The disc occupies the lowest unplayed square on that column. A player 
wins by placing four of their own discs consecutively in a line 
(row, column or diagonal), which ends the game. The game ends in a cat tie if 
the board is filled completely without any player winning.


Controls:


The game begins with player 1 designated as Goku and player 2 designated
as Cell. The game-play is turn-based and will switch accordingly
until the reset button is pressed or the program is exited, at which
point the game will begin again with player 1.

To play, simply click the button above the corresponding column you wish
to drop your piece. Upon any player accomplishing a four-in-a-row, the
winning four pieces will be highlighted in blue and the scoreboard
will be updated. The grid is automatically reset in the event of a win or
tie. To reset the scoreboard, press the Reset Game button or exit the
program. If the Reset Game button is pressed in the midst of game-play, both
the grid and scoreboard will be reset. At any point, in a single game, a player 
can undo his or her last move by clicking the Undo Move button or choosing 
Undo from the Edit menu.
